Connect 4: Terminal Edition

Connect 4 is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This repository hosts a terminal-based implementation of the Connect 4 game, built purely with Python. Challenge your strategic thinking against a basic AI opponent!

### Features

* **Terminal-Based Gameplay:** Play directly in your command line interface.
* **Player vs. AI:** Test your skills against a computer opponent.
* **Interactive Input:** Simple numeric input for dropping discs.
* **Win Condition Detection:** Automatically identifies horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
* **Basic AI Opponent:** A fundamental AI is implemented to provide a challenge (with plans for future enhancements!).

### How to Play

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aayu62/Connect-4-game.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the game directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Connect4-Terminal
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python connect4.py
    ```
    (Assuming your main game file is named `connect4.py`.)

### Future Enhancements

I'm continuously working on improving the game, with a primary focus on:

* **Advanced AI:** Implementing more sophisticated AI algorithms for a tougher and more engaging opponent (e.g., Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning).
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for invalid user inputs.
* **User Interface Improvements:** While still terminal-based, exploring ways to make the display even clearer and more user-friendly.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or even contribute! Your feedback is highly appreciated.
